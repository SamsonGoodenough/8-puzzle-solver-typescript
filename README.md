# n-puzzle-solver-typescript

## Purpose
Tool that can solve random or given n-puzzles (n=8, 15, 24...) using the **A\* search algorithm** and return stats on the solutions.

This is a Typescript port of it's [python based sibling](https://github.com/SamsonGoodenough/8-puzzle-solver) for python's lack of cumputing speads when dealing with large amounts of memory.

## Heuristics
- Displacement
- Manhattan Distance
- Out Of Row Coloumn
- Linear Conflict
- Euclidean
